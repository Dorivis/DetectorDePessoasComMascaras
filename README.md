# Mask Detection | Call for Code 2020

## Introduction
The pandemic generated by the new coronavirus has caused numerous impacts on society. As a way of minimizing the impacts, we created a solution that aims to help the owners of establishments to have an idea of ​​how many people are in each region within the place and if some of these people are not wearing masks.

## The idea
With the help of the establishment's own security cameras, we used some image recognition tools within the IBM Cloud to analyze whether or not the person is wearing masks and in addition, we created a heat map of the region to show which places have a greater amount of people. This information can be useful if those responsible for the establishment want to reorganize the products in order to distribute people between different regions.

## Tools used:
- [Text To Speech](https://www.ibm.com/br-pt/cloud/watson-text-to-speech) - Creating the audible alert
- [IBM Cloud Annotations](https://cloud.annotations.ai/) - Creating the model for video analysis
- [Watson Machine Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/machine-learning) - Model learning

On the home screen, the footage available for the responsible person to view is displayed.

## Detections screen:

On this screen, it is possible to view the video with the system by detecting people with and without masks. With this information and hands, we have a button that sends an audible alert on the establishment's sound system, informing the importance of wearing masks.

Below we have a heat map of the establishment, showing the region that the security camera can reach and a color that varies between green and red according to the number of people in that region. This information can be important for the owner of the establishment, since he can reorganize the products in such a way as to make that region not stay with so many people and consequently with the green color.
